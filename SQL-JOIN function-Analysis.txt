SQL Analysis

-- 1. SQL query that retrieves all records but no duplicate from PRODUCT and SHIP METHODS 
to show which ship methods have been used for which products.

SELECT DISTINCT 
	SM.*
	,P.pName
FROM [SHIP METHODS] SM FULL JOIN [PURCHASE ORDER] PO
		ON SM.shipCode = PO.shipCode
	LEFT JOIN [ORDERED PRODUCTS] OP
		ON (PO.PONum = OP.PONum
		AND PO.accountNum = OP.accountNum
		)
	FULL JOIN PRODUCT P
		ON OP.productNo = P.productNo

-- 2. SQL query to show a table with columns showing customer product order history:
PONum, accountNum, fName, lName, datePlaced, productNo, qtyOrdered, unitPrice.

SELECT PO.PONum
	, C.accountNum
	, C.fName
	, C.lName
	, PO.datePlaced
	, P.productNo
	, OP.qtyOrdered
	, OP.unitPrice
FROM [PURCHASE ORDER] PO LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER C
		ON PO.accountNum = C.accountNum
	 LEFT JOIN [ORDERED PRODUCTS] OP
		ON ( OP.PONum = PO.PONum
			AND OP.accountNum = PO.accountNum
			)
	LEFT JOIN PRODUCT P
		ON P.productNo =OP.productNo

-- 3. Find the distinct shipping codes (shipCode) for purchase orders placed on weekends (datePlaced) 
where the expected delivery date (exptectedDel) is NOT on a Thursday or Friday.

SELECT DISTINCT PO.shipCode
FROM [PURCHASE ORDER] PO
WHERE DATENAME(DW, PO.datePlaced) IN ('Saturday', 'Sunday')
	AND DATENAME(DW, PO.exptectedDel) NOT IN ('Thursday', 'Friday')


-- 4. Retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMER table for customers where either their first and last name (fName, lName) 
or their telephone number and email (telNum, email) do not match the corresponding values in the SHIPTO table.

SELECT C.*
FROM CUSTOMER C JOIN SHIPTO S
	ON C.accountNum = S.accountNum
WHERE (C.fName <> S.fName
		AND C.lName <> S.lName)
	OR (C.telNum <> S.telNum
		AND C.email <> S.email)


-- 5. SQL query to retrieve only customers whose city starts with C, K, or L but does not end with N, and whose zip code contains both 7 and 0 in any order or ends with 1.
Then rename those columns as the following:
Customer Account: accountNum from the CUSTOMER table.
Full Name: Combination of fName, mInitial, and lName.
Purchase Order Number: PONum.
Order Month: Month name from datePlaced.
Order Year: Year from datePlaced. 
Total Additional Cost: Sum of shippingCost, taxAmount, and otherAdjustments.

SELECT C.accountNum AS [Customer Account]
	, C.fName + ' ' + C.mInitial +' '+ C.lName AS [Full Name]
	, PO.PONum AS [Purchase Order Number]
	, DATENAME(MM, PO.datePlaced) AS [Order Month]
	, DATENAME(YY, PO.datePlaced) AS [Order Year]
	, (PO.shippingCost + PO.taxAmount + PO.otherAdjustments) AS [Total Additional Cost]
FROM CUSTOMER C FULL JOIN [PURCHASE ORDER] PO
	ON C.accountNum = PO.accountNum
WHERE (C.city LIKE '[CKL]%[^N]')
	AND 
	((C.zipCode LIKE '%7%' 
	AND C.zipCode LIKE'%0%')
	OR 
	C.zipCode LIKE '%1')
